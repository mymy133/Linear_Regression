# Salary Prediction – Comparing Linear Regression Models
##  Overview
This project predicts **salary** based on **years of experience** using different regression models.  The aim is to compare how various linear and non-linear approaches perform on the same dataset.
## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle – Salary Dataset for Simple Linear Regression   
- **Features:**
  - `YearsExperience` – Number of years of professional experience  
  - `Salary` – Annual salary in USD  


## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- SciPy


## 🚀 Models Tested
1. **Linear Regression**  
2. **Ridge Regression**  
3. **Polynomial Regression** (degree 2, 3, 4)  
4. **Univariate Spline Regression** (2, 3, and 5 segments)


## 📊 Visualizations
- Scatter plot of **Years of Experience vs Salary**
- Regression lines for each model
- Comparison chart of R² scores
